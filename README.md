# Canopus-Chat-Application
A Unique Chat Application...

### This is a chat application which I built when I was in 8th grade. One of the serious self project that I worked upon!

Features included:
+ Email based Authentication
+ Unique usernames
+ Group based Chatting
+ A ting sound when sending or receiving a text
+ Can check for updates
+ Notifications to others when a message is sent

## Uniqueness:
Instead of using the term 'Group', I used a rather different word, 'STAR'. You can create your own star and invite your friends to your star and chat!

Features I would want to add:
- [ ] Invitation System
- [ ] Personal chatting
